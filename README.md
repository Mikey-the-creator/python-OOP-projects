# Advanced Bank Account Simulation (Python OOP)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose
This project is part of my internship preparation roadmap (Day 4) to strengthen my **Python Object-Oriented Programming** skills.  
It simulates a real-world bank account system with secure balance handling, transaction history logging, interest calculations, and account-to-account transfers.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Deposit & Withdraw**: Add or remove funds with validation.
- **Interest Calculation**: Apply a given percentage of interest to the balance.
- **Transaction History**: Logs all operations (type, amount, balance after transaction, timestamp).
- **Account Transfers**: Securely move funds between accounts.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects account data from being modified directly.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable for additional banking features.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Datetime** module for timestamps
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
